# Zabbix-to-Outlook-webscrape

This VBA macro integrates Microsoft Outlook with Zabbix in Internet Explorer. The macro web scrapes Zabbix triggers in IE and populates a new e-mail with the subject and Zabbix trigger information. This helps when escalating quickly to tier 2 teams.  

I also added more code to populate the ticket information in our ticketing system (Maximo in Internet Explorer).
